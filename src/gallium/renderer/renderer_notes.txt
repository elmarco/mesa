To use GL 3.x in the renderer we need to handle the deprecated stuff - 

two sided rendering - normals in shader or something

not user vertex/index arrays - should be okay

no more windowpos/drawpixels - todo - avoid use in core renderer - gallium doesn't have these.

non-sprite points - hmm

wide lines and stiple - 

polygon, quads, quad_strip - we can probably do this in the guest using gallium.

polygon stipple - can we fix in guest?

pixel transfer modes + ops - maps, shift/bias - all avoidable with gallium - 24-bit depth problems.

DrawPixels + PixelZoom - avoidable

texture formats alpha etc. - painful - need to rewrite shaders somehow
